about:
    description: |
        Hi there! I'm a highly motivated and driven Computer Science undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University.
        I love to design and build user-centric software that is both functional and beautiful.
        I believe that technology has the potential to make the world a better place, and I am passionate about creating practical and meaningful solutions to the problems we face in everyday life. As Steve Jobs said, "Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have faith in people, that they're basically good and smart â€” and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them."
        Besides my passion in technology, I am also an avid reader of Wuxia (Martial Heroes) novels, and regularly jog to help manage stress and find enjoyment in this fast-paced and competitive city.
